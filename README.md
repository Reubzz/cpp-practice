## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: Time Complexity is defined as the number of times a particular instruction set is executed rather than the total time taken. It is because the total time took also depends on some external factors like the compiler used, processorâ€™s speed, etc.

- **Space Complexity**: Space Complexity is the total memory space required by the program for its execution.

Both are calculated as the function of input size(n).

- **Types Of Time Complexity:**

  - **Best Time Complexity**: Define the input for which algorithm takes less time or minimum time. In the best case calculate the lower bound of an algorithm. Example: In the linear search when search data is present at the first location of large data then the best case occurs.
  - **Average Time Complexity**: In the average case take all random inputs and calculate the computation time for all inputs. And then we divide it by the total number of inputs.
  - **Worst Time Complexity**: Define the input for which algorithm takes a long time or maximum time. In the worst calculate the upper bound of an algorithm. Example: In the linear search when search data is present at the last location of large data then the worst case occurs.
